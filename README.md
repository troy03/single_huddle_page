## My process


 My process first was build first a background and applying a flexbox its an easiest way to this single page than grid.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Have a time limit to a specific project just to add a pressure to yourself and I improve using

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px){}
```
this was my first time applying media queries without using a tutorial or documentation.

### Continued development

Will need to improve a Responsive Design
